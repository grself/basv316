# University of Arizona South BASV 316: Introductory Methods of Analysis

This repository contains my text, lab manual, and blog for the University of Arizona South BASV 316, Business Research Methods, that I teach online. It is still under development but will be updated in time for the spring, 2018 class (I hope).

I'm using the Blogdown system and linked this repository to Netlify so I can simply push changes to GitHub and they will automatically be deployed to the website. I'm using the "Academic" theme and have modified it just a bit. I repurposed "Projects" to "Text" in order to hold the textbook I'm writing, "Tutorial" will hold the R Lab Manual that I wrote and have used for a couple of years, and the blog will hold my weekly updates and class notes.
