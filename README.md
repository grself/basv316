# University of Arizona South BASV 316: Introductory Methods of Analysis

This repository contains the source code for my text and lab manual for the University of Arizona South BASV 316, Introductory Methods of Analysis, that I teach online. The site is still under development but will be updated in time for the spring, 2019 class (I hope).

The website can be found at (https://basv316.com).

That landing page contains links to two sub-domains:
